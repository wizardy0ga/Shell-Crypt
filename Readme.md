## Quick Info
Shell-Crypt is a utility for encrypting shellcode for C/C++ based implants using [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or). It works by encrypting your shellcode with a key of your chosen size and then encrypting the key with a self-bruteforcing xor algorithm. Shell-Crypt provides the operator with the code necessary to decrypt the key and shellcode. It is up to the operator to take the code produced by Shell-Crypt and integrate it into their own implant.

</br>

## Functions & Features

:heavy_check_mark: Evade scan time detection for heavily signatured shellcodes such as msfvenom  
:heavy_check_mark: Hide key from static analysis via encryption  
:heavy_check_mark: Self bruteforcing key  
:heavy_check_mark: Internal validation function to run shellcode & key through decryption & execution process 

## Usage

`ShellCrypt.exe [Key Generation Command] [Input Shellcode File] [Output Shellcode File] [Optional Arguments]`  

Shellcrypt takes 4 positional arguments.

### Positional Arguments
- Key Generation Command
    - This is used to generate the encryption key for the shellcode. To generate a key, use the syntax **gen-keysize**. **gen-** tells Shell-Crypt to generate a key and the **keysize** is the size in bytes of the key to generate. Alternatively, the operator may pass a key of there own to be used instead.

- Input Shellcode File
    - The shellcode to encrypt

- Output Shellcode File
    - The name of the file to write the shellcode to. Existence of file does not matter.

- Optional Arguments
    - Any number of flagged arguments to augment the behavior of the program. No specific order is necessary.

### Optional Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| -p | Print out the plain text version of the key and shellcode
| -q | Suppress the encrypted shellcode output in stdout. Only shows the key, hint byte & decryption functions.
| -t | QOL feature. Run the key / shellcode through the decryption process & execute in local thread to validate functionality

### Usage Examples
- Generate a 256 byte key, write encrypted shellcode to file.  
    - `Shell-Crypt.exe gen-256 ./shellcode.bin ./encrypted.bin`  

- Encrypt shellcode with key `00d74f9fbbe24026a9bbb65504c51689`, output to file, only print key / decryption function to terminal
    - `Shell-Crypt.exe 00d74f9f-bbe2-4026-a9bb-b65504c51689 ./shellcode.bin ./encrypted.bin -q`  

- Generate a 56 byte key, output to file & show the plain text version of the shellcode  
    - `Shell-Crypt.exe gen-56 ./shellcode.bin ./encrypted.bin -p `

- Generate a 200 byte key, output to file, only show decryption components, validate the key / shellcode
    `Shell-Crypt.exe gen-200 ./shellcode.bin ./encrypted.bin -t -q`

## Integration Into Your Implant
To integrate the decrytion routing in your implant, you will need to follow these steps in the order of presentation
- Decrypt the key
- Decrypt the shellcode with the decrypted key

### Example
This example injects shellcode into microsoft edge and executes using remote function stomping.

## Evasion Results
The example code above uses the windows/x64/exec payload from msfvenom. Encrypting the shellcode results in an ~ 67% reduction of detections in comparison to the unencrypted version. As with all evasion techniques, there is no single silver bullet. To successfully execute your payload on a target, other evasion techniques will have to be implemented within your implant. This tool offers an easy method of implementing a particular scan time evasion technique for heavily signatured shellcode.
